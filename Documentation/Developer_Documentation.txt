Dealer hand play logic:

Count_Max = First ace counts 11, any remaining aces count 1
Count_Min = All aces count 1

Dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. Dealer busts on greater than 21.

	If Count_Max <= 16, dealer must hit

	If Count_Max >= 17, dealer must stand

	If Count_Max > 21, that would be a bust, so then
		If Count_Min <= 16, dealer must hit
		if Count_Min >= 17, dealer must stand
		if Count_Min > 21, then dealer busts

	So, proceed to stand or bust using Count_Max,
		If stand, then done, and report out Count_Max as final hand count
		If bust, then proceed to stand or bust using Count_Min
			If stand, then done, and report out Count_Min as final hand count
			If bust, then report hand status as bust
