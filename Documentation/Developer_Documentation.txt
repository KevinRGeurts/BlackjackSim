*** Casino Dealer hand play logic:

Count_Max = First ace counts 11, any remaining aces count 1
Count_Min = All aces count 1

Dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. Dealer busts on greater than 21.

	If Count_Max <= 16, dealer must hit

	If Count_Max >= 17, dealer must stand

	If Count_Max > 21, that would be a bust, so then
		If Count_Min <= 16, dealer must hit
		if Count_Min >= 17, dealer must stand
		if Count_Min > 21, then dealer busts

	So, proceed to stand or bust using Count_Max,
		If stand, then done, and report out Count_Max as final hand count
		If bust, then proceed to stand or bust using Count_Min
			If stand, then done, and report out Count_Min as final hand count
			If bust, then report hand status as bust

*** Holye Player hand play logic:

Always stand on 17

Always hit on 12 and under

For 13 - 16:
	Stand, if dealer shows 6 or lower
	Hit, if dealer shows 7 - 10, J, Q, K, or A

Count an Ace as 1 up to 17 (e.g., hit 2-4-A, counting it as 7)

So, trying to put all this together into a workflow...

	Test hands for each outcome are shown in [].

	Check Count_Max
		If Count_Max > 17 and <= 21, then stand [A 7] Test 1
		If Count_Max <= 17 or > 21, then check Count_Min [A 6]; [A 6 5] Test 2
	Check Count_Min
		If Count_Min > 21, then bust [A 6 5 K] Test 2
		If Count_Min >= 17, then stand [A 6 5 7] Test 3
		If Count_Min <= 12, then hit [A 6 5] Test 2, Test 3
		If Count_Min >=13 and <= 16, then [A 6 5 2] Test 4
			If dealer shows <= 6 (their one face up card), then stand (expecting dealer to hit and bust) [show = 6] Test 4
			If dealer shows 7 - 10, J, Q, K, A, then hit [A 6 5 2 3] [show = 7] Test 5
	After hitting, return to Check Count_Max

	Construct the following test cases
	Test 1 "Stand Max": Hand[A 7] Deck[...] show[...] Stand
	Test 2 "Bust Min": Hand[A 6] Deck[5 K] show[...] Hit Hit Bust
	Test 3 "stand min over seventeen": Hand[A 6] Deck[5 7] show[...] Hit Hit Stand
	Test 4 "stand min on show six or under": Hand[A 6] Deck[5 2] show[6] Hit Hit Stand
	Test 5 "stand min on show over six": Hand[A 6] Deck[5 2 3] show[7] Hit Hit Hit Stand
